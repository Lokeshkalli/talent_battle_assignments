8) HTML tags like <a> can have certain attributes. The href attribute is
mandatory in the <a> tag. Additionally, it is possible to use the title attribute
which specifies a text that emerges when the mouse cursor is moved above a
link. This kind of text is called a tool tip. Modify the link that you created in the
previous exercise so that a tool tip says "This leads you to another page." when
the mouse cursor is over the link.
