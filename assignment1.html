    <p>It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.</p>
    <p>The name python was named after his favorite Tv series <u> "Monty Python’s Flying Circus"</u></p>

    <h2><em> Uses:</em> </h2>
    <p>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</p>
    <p> Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.

    <h2><em> Applications: </em>  </h2>


    <h3>Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning</h3>
    <p>Many AI and ML models are built using Python. Data analysts use it too. The fundamental cause for this is the availability of many tools and libraries specific to these applications. Some of them include:</p>
    <img src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.PTXHpPJ4rrDKqhSiVBGHMAHaEK&pid=Api&P=0" alt="AI & ML">
    <p>Pandas for Data Manipulation and Analysis.
    </p>
    <p>NumPy and SciPy for mathematical computations.
    </p>

    <p>Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualization.
    </p>

    <p>Scikit learn, Tensor Flow, Keras for algorithms
    </p>
    <h3> Desktop GUI Development</h3>

    <p>Its simplicity and platform independence nature make it a good choice for GUI applications. Though Tkinter is the standard library for GUI development, there are other supporting libraries like :

        Wx Python
        Kivy
        PyQt, PySide
        PyGUI
        Delphi
        GTK+ </p>

    <h2><em>Future scope:</em></h2>
<p>The Future Scope of a Python Developer is very bright The world is getting digitized. Python has become the core language as far as the success of these technologies is concerned. Let’s dive into the technologies which use python as a core element for research, production and further developments. <mark>The future is all about automating processes and utilizing the heaps of data to make intelligent decisions.</mark>  This puts to the forefront technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine and deep learning, Internet of Things (IoT), etc.</p>
